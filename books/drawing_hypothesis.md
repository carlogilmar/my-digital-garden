# Drawing a Hypothesis

- The pool of diagrammatic images and symbols is a permanent part our daily perception.
- Perception is a cognitive act of perceiving, translating and allocating occurs continuously when we compose thoughts and receive or process information.
- This process always happens through drawing connections: the structures of the semantic relationships emodied in the anatomical organisation of our brains allow us to interact with others through language and behaviour.
- Drawing can mediate between language and behavior, it plays a constitutive role in the production and communication of knowdlegde. 
- The genesis of ideas is often directly conndected with graphical thinking.
- The drawing of figures thus reveals itself to be one of the oldest of all mankind's cultural techniques and remains to this day a fundamental instrument in any kind of artistic or scientific praxis.
