# Engineering Management for the rest of us by Sarah Drasner

# Part 1 
## Chapter 1 Caring for your team

- Where your work used to be about you and what value you brought to a team, your work is now about enabling everyone around you.
- Make your team flow-driven, this will envolve a lot of communication and collaboration.
- Your work affects people's daily lives.
- You need to understand power imbalances, peoples structures and consider strategies.
- Caring is vital to doing this job well.

## Chapter 2 The value of values

1. Values work is a tool: it gives us some rubric to undertanding where a person might be coming from.
2. It give us a perspective about where to start when building understanding and trust within a group. Unpacking a person's values with them can also help us understand what drives and motivates them.
3. Values are fundamental beliefs that guide us, motivate us, and drive our accions. 
4. You can see how a person's values dictate their behavior and ethics.
5. This is a list of words to express values:
```
Accountability, advocacy, autonomy, compassion, collaboration, contribution, creativity, curiosity, dependability, diversity, empathy, ethics, excellence, fairness, family, friendships, fun, growth, happiness, health, honesty, humility, humor, inclusiveness, independece, knowledge, performance, personal development, spiritually, perfection, power, preparedness, reliability, sucess, teamwor,, traditionailm, trustworthiness, versatility, vision, warmth, wealth. 
```

6. Values provide us context so that we can be more understanding of what is happening and why.
7. The act of sharing values can also have a side effect of building trust and vulnerability on a team.
8. Values privide context to a person's mental state, needs, and motivations. In practice understanding the values of your team members becomes a useful tool to evalueate and drive your own empathy.
9. We're each individuals, and we have our own lived expenciences, values, and boundaries. It's important to pay  attention to these and communcate them to others.
10. Communciating our own values also gives our employees a bit of context about our working style and needs.
11. Unpacking our own values allow us to notce patterns in our life where we felt very aligned and to see patterns where things didn't feel right.
12. We can also see how our own values play out in times of conflict.
13. Understanding the correlation between your values and what you care about as a leader can be a great exercise to understand your own motivations, needs, and boundaries.
14. Companies also have values and it's pretty crucial that those values aligh at least in part with your own.
15. Good company values do this, they convey a viewpoint that you can easily understand and check againts.
16. Leadership is all about driving clarity, and company values should make it clear what the driving forces are in your organization.
17. I make a list of team values foir whatever organization I run:

```
- We celebrate everyone's wins as though they're our own.
- No compare and despair.
- Be empowered to forge fordward, we hired you because you're an expert.
- Make mistakes.
- Choose impact over butts in seats.
```

18. Giving your team space to build values together is important.
19. Working on a team with values that largely aligh with your own is nice. Clarity is what we're aiming for here. CLARITY is key.
20. Values are so key to who you are a a person that it's sometimes not enough to identify them, you also have to protect them.
21. Misalignment with too many fundamental values can lead to burnout. Boundaries are important to healthy working environment because everyone has slightly different boundaries.
22. What it's interesting about discusting values as part of a group is to see where they interesect, overlap or have gaps.
23. Conducting a values exercises in your team gives way to tools that are applicable in so many contexts: feedback, managing conflict, 1:1, prioritization.

# Chapter 3 Trust and vulnerability

1. Trust takes time. Trust is the thing you will want most to buld with a team.
2. My job as manager it's to enable the people around me to do their best work together.
  - Enable: supporting, growing, and nuturing the development of other people.
  - The people around me: A good manager looks at the wider ecosystem.
  - To do their best work: Os a synthesis of what they can and like to do and what the company needs.
  - Together: Team dynamics.

3. Healthy environment:
  - Hearing each other out: you need healthy debates to come up with the best plan and outcome.
  - Finding the human in the mistakes: people can show humility about the mistake and learn.
  - Creativity: Trust and happiness support and develop creativity.
  - Making our jobs more enjoyable: We can be ourselfes, make jokes and be within a trusted group can help us feel included.

4. It's hard to model vulnerability.
5. You as leader have to go first.
6. The team needs to know you're human.
7. Your teem needs to see one another with a regular cadence.
  - Brief standup twice weekly can be productive.
  - Let people chat.
  - Make jokes.
  - Psychologial safety spaces.
