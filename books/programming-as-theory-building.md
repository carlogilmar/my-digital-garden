# Programming as Building Theory by Peter Naur

- Programming properly should be regarded as an activity by which the programmers form or achieve a certain kind of insight, a theory, of the matters at hand.

## Programming and the programmers knowledge

- Programming is the whole activity of design and implementation of programmed solutions. It's the activity of matching some significant part and aspect of an activity in the real world to the formal symbol manipulation that can be done by a program running on a computer.
- Certain kinds of large programs, the continued adaptation, modification and correction of errors in them is dependent on certain kind of knowledge possesed by a group of programmers involved in the project.
- What will be considered here is the suggestion that the programmers knowledge properly should be regarded as a theory.
- A person who has or posesses a theory in this sesnse knows how to do certain things and in addition can support the actual doing with explanations, justifications, and answers to queries about the activity of concern.
- What characterizes intellectual activity over and beyond activity that is merely intelligent is the person's building and having a theory where theory is understood as the knowledge a person myst have in order not only to do certain things intelligently but also to explain them, to answers queries about them, to argue about them and so forth. 
- A person who has a theory is prepared to enter into such activities; while building the theory the person is trying to get it.
- The notion of theory in the sense used here applies not only to the elaborate constructions of specialized fields of enquiry, but equally to activities that any person who has received education will participate on certain ocassions.
- The person having the theory must have an understanding of the manner in which the central lays apply to certain aspects of reality, so as to be able to recognize and apply the theory to other similar aspects. 
- References by Popper, Ryle and Thomas Kuhn.

## The theory to be built by the programmer

- What has to be built by the programmer is a theory of how certain affairs of the world will be handled by or supported by a computer program.
- On the Theory Building View of programming the theory built by the programmers has primacy over such other products as program text, user documentation and additional specifications.
- The programmer's knowledge transcends that given in documentation in at least three essential areas
  1. The programmer having the theory of the program can explain how the solution relates to the affairs of te world that if helps to handle. The programmer must be able to explain, for each part if the program text and for each of it's overall structural characteristics, what aspect or activity of the world is matched by it. FOr any aspect or activity of the world the programmer is able to state it's manner of mapping into the program text.
  2. The programmer having the theory of the program can explain why each part of the program is what it is, in other words, is able to support the actual program text with justification of some sort (intuitive knowledge).
  3. The programmer having the theory of the program is able to respond constructively to any demand for a modification of the program so as to support the affairs of the world in a new manner.

## Problems and costs of program modifications

- A reason for proposing the Theory Building View of programming is the desire to establish an insight into programming suitable for supporting a sound understanding of program modifications.
- Software will be modified.
- What is needed in a modification, first of all, is a oncfrontation of the existing solutions with the demands called for by the desired modification. 
- The kinf of similarity that has to be recognized is accesible to the human beings who possess the theory of the program.
- Problems of program modificayion arise from acting on the assumption that programming consist of a program text production instead of recognizing programming as an activity of theory building.
- On the basis of the Theory Building View the decay of a program text as a result of modifications made by programmers without a proper grasp of the underlying theory becomes understandable.
- For a program to retain it's quality it's mandatory that each modification is firmly grounded in the theory of it.
