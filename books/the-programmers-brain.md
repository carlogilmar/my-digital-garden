# The Programmers Brain

Notes from The Programmer's brain by Felienne Hermans

## 1. Decoding your confusion while coding

- Code is a mental decoding process.
- Confussion involves cognitive processes.
- Confussion processes:
  - `Lack of knowledge`: understand what are you doing.
  - `Lack of information`: understand how this is happening. 
  - `Lack of processing power`: be able to execute the code in your brain.
- Cognitive processes associated:
  - Lack of knowledge: `LTM` Long term memory.
  - Lack of information: `STM` Short term memory. 
  - Lack of processing power: `Working memory`.
- The three cognitive processes work together when you're coding.
- LTM could be the knowlege and experience using a language intructions.
- STM could be the variables used to implement a piece of code.3

## 2. Speed reading for code

- "Programs must be writter for people to read and only incidentally for machines to execute" `Harold Abelson`.
- There is often a lot of focus on producing code.
- `STM` is limited (6 slots).
- **Chunking technique** to read code: read a piece of code for 3 minutes and try to remember it. Chunks help to structure your interpretation.
- Iconic memory: space to store sensory memory.
- Iconic memory can be procressed in the STM.
- **Iconic exercise:** look the code for a short time and the reflecting on what you have seen.
- Chunkeable code is about use conventions and patterns to help you to process code faster.
- When code contains comments, programmers will take more time to read it. (How do we read algorithms? Martha Crosby)
- **Beacons** are a piece of code contains certain data or approach.
- **Beacons** are a trigger for programmers to confirm or refute hyphotesis about the source. ðŸ˜²

# Resumption Strategies for Interrupted Programming Tasks

`Introduction`
- Interruptions remain problematic.
- Tasks resumed after an interruption were more difficult to perfirms and took twice as long.
- 1 hour per day is spent managing interruptions
- Devs required 15 minutes to recover from an interruption.
- Programmers have to read, comprehending a program in order to resume work.

`Background`
- `Mental unit`: idea of maintaining a representation of task context to help to reduce mental workload during development.
- Risk of interruptions includes the loss of detais and increased time to recover working state.
- Task execution: 1) planning, 2) execution and 3) evaluation. 
- The benefit of this representation would be in the ability to reduce interference on recall of nono-relevant code. 
- Developers need to record prospective tasks that they are unable to complete at the moment.
- Failure to remember **prospective tasks** is a common occurrence with interrupted tasks.
