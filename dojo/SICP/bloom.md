# Equilibrium Protocol

1. ´Plan Soft Weeks´: “Sustainable pace over burnout.” Proactively reduce intensity to recover from stress. Focus on low-conflict, creative, or isolable tasks. Reclaim your rhythm.
2. ´Set Boundaries, Protect Energy´: “You are not the failsafe for a failing process.” Define what you won’t fix. Say no to dysfunctional habits. Protect your energy by choosing where to invest it.
3. Reconnect with Purpose: “Meaning survives even in messy places.” Anchor to something you care about — a feature, a tool, a pattern, a learning moment. Let small wins refill your motivation.
4. ´Act with Integrity, Not in Anger´: “Channel anger into clarity.” Pause before reacting. Journal patterns. Use documentation, not retaliation. Stay grounded — your professionalism is your strength.
5. ´Reflect and Reassess´: Every few weeks, step back. Is this project still aligned with your values? What has changed? Plan your next move intentionally.
