## Extreme Programming

> What if we take good practices and push them to the extreme? XP = adaptive, human-centered, feedback-driven development.

1. Testing? → Test all the time (TDD).
2. Code reviews? → Do them continuously (pair programming).
3. Integration? → Integrate constantly (continuous integration).
4. Feedback? → Short feedback loops everywhere.

## 2 - Learning to Drive

1. Software development = **continuous correction**, not rigid planning.
2. **Feedback is your steering wheel** — without it, you drift off course.
3. **Courage to change direction is essential** — XP teams welcome steering corrections instead of fearing them.

## XP Discipline

- **Change is inevitable**: XP gives you practices to embrace it rather than fight it.
- **Push good practices to the extreme**: this reveals weaknesses but also strengthens discipline.
- **XP is both technical and social**: it’s about coding practices (tests, refactoring, CI) and team practices (communication, respect, courage).

## XP Without Soul
- Pair programming can degrade into “peer pressure.”
- CI/CD can become “busy pipelines” without meaningful feedback.
- Tests can exist but not actually guide design.
