## Extreme Programming

> What if we take good practices and push them to the extreme? XP = adaptive, human-centered, feedback-driven development.

1. Testing? → Test all the time (TDD).
2. Code reviews? → Do them continuously (pair programming).
3. Integration? → Integrate constantly (continuous integration).
4. Feedback? → Short feedback loops everywhere.

## 2. Learning to Drive

1. Software development = **continuous correction**, not rigid planning.
2. **Feedback is your steering wheel** — without it, you drift off course.
3. **Courage to change direction is essential** — XP teams welcome steering corrections instead of fearing them.

## 3. Values

1. **Communication**
  - Most problems in software come from miscommunication.
  - XP promotes shared code, pair programming, tests-as-documentation, on-site customers — all ways to keep conversations alive.
2. **Simplicity**
  - Do the simplest thing that could possibly work.
  - Don’t design for speculative futures.
  - Simplicity keeps code flexible and cheap to change.
3. **Feedback**
  - Rapid feedback at all levels:
	  - Tests (is the code correct?)
    - CI (does the system still work together?)
    - Customer feedback (does it solve the real problem?).
    - Feedback lets you steer like in the _Learning to Drive_ chapter.
4. **Courage**
  - Courage to throw code away.
  - Courage to refactor mercilessly.
  - Courage to say “I don’t know” or “this isn’t working.”
5. **Respect** 
  - Teams only thrive if members respect each other’s contributions.
  - Without respect, practices like pair programming or collective ownership become toxic.

## XP Discipline

- **Change is inevitable**: XP gives you practices to embrace it rather than fight it.
- **Push good practices to the extreme**: this reveals weaknesses but also strengthens discipline.
- **XP is both technical and social**: it’s about coding practices (tests, refactoring, CI) and team practices (communication, respect, courage).
- XP is not just a checklist of practices. **It’s a value system for software development** that makes change safe, teamwork healthy, and code evolvable.

## XP Without Soul
- Pair programming can degrade into “peer pressure.”
- CI/CD can become “busy pipelines” without meaningful feedback.
- Tests can exist but not actually guide design.
