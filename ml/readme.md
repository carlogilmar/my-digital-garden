# Machine Learning Study Group

## Week 1

> Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Arthur Samuel 1950

- Types of ML algorithms
  - Supervised learning
  - Unsupervised learning
  - Recommender systems
  - Reinforcement learning

**Supervised Learning**
- Algorithms that learning from X input generate Y output.
- Learns from being given right answers.
- Ej. `X: email -> Y: is_spam`, `X:audio -> Y: text transcript`, `X: spanish -> Y: english`, 
- You should train your model with examples inputs X and outputs Y.

*Example of practical use of supervised learning: housing price prediction*
