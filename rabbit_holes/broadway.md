Notes about Broadway:

- Broadway is a sort of mini-framework for the GenStage library.
- Broadway grew out of a focus “on events and on operational features, such as metrics, automatic acknowledgements, failure handling, and so on.
- In both libraries, back-pressure allows “consumers” to signal producers their availability to receive data. Producers stop sending data to a consumer when it meets its capacity, and begins sending data again once the consumer has dealt with its backlog. 
- We only get the amount of events necessary from upstream sources, never flooding the pipeline.
- Broadway automatically acknowledges messages at the end of the pipeline or in case of errors.
- Broadway enables you to choose how best to handle the errors and the data that caused them.
- Broadway provides built-in batching, allowing you to group messages either by size and/or by time.
- Broadway pipelines are carefully designed to minimize data loss. 
- Broadway ships with a built-in test API, making it easy to push test messages through the pipeline and making sure the event was properly processed.
- Broadway allows developers to batch messages based on dynamic partitions.

## Example

- A broadway app has two components: producers and consumers. 
- Producers are GenStage modules which produces events.
- The Consumers processes the events generated by producers.
- Transformers are only needed if your producer doesn’t return a `%Broadway.Message{}`

How to implement:
* 1. Create a producer module using `GenStage`.
* 2. Implement a transformer module to create Broadway Messages from producers.
* 3. Implement Broadway configuration and setup
  * Handle the configuration in the `start_link`
  * The previous implementation starts a Broadway process linked to the current one.
  * `Name` option is used for name registration.
  * `Producers` is a key for define multiple producers. (We need to declare the producer module, the transformer module and number of processes to be started)
  * `Processors`: Single processor could be defined here.
  * `handle_message/3`: Here you can do any kind of processing with the incoming message.


1. Add the broadway dep: `{:broadway, "~> 1.0"}`.
2. Create the broadway module with the configuration to start.
3. Add the broadway module in your supervisor.
4. Create the producer module.
5. Create the transformer module.
6. Add the functions to handle the producer info.

`Producer`
``` elixir
defmodule MyApp.Counter do
  use GenStage

  def start_link(number) do
    GenStage.start_link(Counter, number)
  end

  def init(counter) do
    {:producer, counter}
  end

  //We create the handle_demand/2 function to receive “demand” from processors
  def handle_demand(demand, counter) when demand > 0 do
    events = Enum.to_list(counter..counter+demand-1)

    {:noreply, events, counter + demand}
  end
end
```

  `Transformer`
```elixir
defmodule MyApp.CounterMessage do
  def transform(event, _opts) do
    message = %Broadway.Message{
      data: event,
      acknowledger: {__MODULE__, :ack_id, event}
    }
  end

  def ack(_ref, _successes, _failures) do
    :ok
  end
end
```

  <summary>Configuration</summary>

  
`Configuration`
```elixir
defmodule MyApp do
  use Broadway

  alias Broadway.Message

  def start_link(_opts) do
    Broadway.start_link(__MODULE__,
      name: MyAppExample,
      producer: [
        default: [
          module: {MyApp.Counter, 0},
          transformer: {MyApp.CounterMessage, :transform, []},
          concurrency: 1 // rename stages to concurrency
        ]
      ],
      processors: [
        default: [stages: 2]
      ],
    )
  end

  def handle_message(:default, %Message{data: data} = message, _context) do
    Process.sleep 1000

    message
    |> IO.inspect
  end
end
```

  <summary>Broadway Message</summary>

`Configuration`
```elixir
  %Broadway.Message{
  acknowledger: {MyApp.CounterMessage, :ack_id, 0},
  batch_key: :default,
  batcher: :default,
  data: 0,
  metadata: %{},
  status: :ok
}

### Gen Stage

**Problems to deal when scaling systems:**

- Problem to deal: finite memory and CPU power available. 
- Server may become overwhelmed.
- We can hit a limit on a resource available to us.
- Make the best use of resources should be apriotiry when designing and scaling software.

Using the GenStage library we are going to build a data-processing pipeline.
 
> When we talk about using back-pressure, we actually mean using a mechanism to control or handle back- pressure in a beneficial way.

### The library

> GenStage is a new Elixir behaviour for exchanging events with back-pressure between Elixir processes.

- The GenStage behaviour is used to build stages. 
- Stages are also Elixir processes and they’re our building blocks for creating data-processing pipelines
- They can receive events and use them to do some useful work
- They can also send events to the next stage in the pipeline.
- A stage can also have multiple instances of itself 
- Since stages are processes, this effectively means running more than one process of the same stage type.
- Their most important feature is back-pressure.

There are three different types of stages:
1. producer
2. consumer
3. producer-consumer

**Producer:**

- It's the source of data that flows into the pipeline
