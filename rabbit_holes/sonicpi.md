# Sonic Pi

Concepts to know:

Sonic Pi Essentials

- `BPM` stands for Beats Per Minute. Itâ€™s a unit of measurement for the tempo or speed of a song, indicating how many beats (or rhythmic pulses) occur in one minute.
- `live_loop` is a key feature of Sonic Pi that allows you to repeat a block of code indefinitely
- `use_synth :fm`: Use the FM (Frequency Modulation) synthesizer for generating sounds. Synths: `:tb303`, `:prophet`
- `play_pattern_timed`: This is a function that plays a sequence of notes (a pattern) at a specified time interval.
- `amp: 1.5`: This controls the volume (amplitude) of the sound.
- `release: 0.5`: This controls how long the note's sound will continue after you press it.
- `sync` command: It tells this loop to wait for the `:bassline` loop to finish its current iteration before it starts playing.

```ruby
# Set BPM
use_bpm 118

# Iconic Bassline
live_loop :bassline do
  use_synth :fm
  play_pattern_timed [:g2, :g2, :g2, :g2, :a2, :a2, :a2, :g2],
    [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25],
    amp: 1.5, # volume
    release: 0.5 # how long will continue
end

# Chords for Harmony
live_loop :chords do
  sync :bassline
  use_synth :piano
  play_chord [:g3, :b3, :d4], release: 2
  sleep 2
  play_chord [:a3, :c4, :e4], release: 2
  sleep 2
end

# Beat
live_loop :drums do
  sample :bd_808, amp: 1.5
  sleep 0.5
  sample :sn_dub, amp: 1.2
  sleep 0.5
  sample :bd_808, amp: 1.5
  sleep 0.5
  sample :drum_cymbal_closed, amp: 0.8
  sleep 0.5
end

# Melody Hint (optional)
live_loop :melody do
  sync :bassline
  use_synth :pluck
  
  # Simplified vocal hint
  play_pattern_timed [:b4, :c5, :d5, :e5], [0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 1], amp: 1.2
  sleep 1.5
end
```


## Documentation Examples

```ruby
live_loop :flibble do
  sample :bd_haus, rate: 1
  sleep 0.5
end
```

```ruby
live_loop :flibble do
  sample :ambi_choir, rate: 0.5
  sample :bd_haus, rate: 2
  sleep 1
end
```

```ruby
live_loop :guit do
  with_fx :echo, mix: 0.3, phase: 0.25 do
    sample :guit_em9, rate: 0.5
  end
  
  sample :guit_em9, rate: -0.5
  sleep 8
end

live_loop :boom do
  with_fx :reverb, room: 1 do
    sample :bd_boom, amp: 10, rate: 1
  end
  sleep 8
end
```

```ruby
# This is a Beat
play 72
sleep 0.5
play 75
sleep 0.5
play 79
```

```ruby
# Play random notes
100.times do
  play rrand_i(60, 90)
  sleep 0.5
end
```

```ruby
# Play a chord
loop do
  play chord(60, :M7).tick
  sleep 0.5
end
```

```ruby
## Example 5 - play a chord with an arpeggio
loop do
  play chord(60, :M7), release: 3
  16.times do
    play chord(60, :M7).choose
    sleep 0.25
  end
end
```

```ruby
## Example 6 - play a shifting chord with an arpeggio
start_notes = ring(60, 62, 63, 62)
loop do
  my_chord = chord(start_notes.tick, :M7)
  play my_chord, release: 2
  16.times do
    play my_chord.choose
    sleep 0.125
  end
end
```

```ruby
## Example 7 - play a drum
sample :drum_bass_hard
```

```ruby
# Cool drumps
live_loop :drums do
  sample :loop_amen, beat_stretch: 2,amp:0.5
  sleep 2
  sample :elec_plip
end
```
